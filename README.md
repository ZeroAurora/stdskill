Best practices. No excuse.

I've had enough of troubles with my agents. They edit my `eslint.config.cjs` to disable `no-undef` rule. They use `as unknown as` to cast types everywhere. They downgrade my dependency without me being asked. They write unit tests that are not even checking the code.

So here it is. The standard skill set. Written by a human.
